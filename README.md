# 👋 Hi, I’m VERSE-Web!

> *Self-proclaimed boring, dumb, and totally into codding/osinting. Welcome, fellow newbies and code explorers!*

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

- **Full-Stack Web Dev** (or at least trying my best!)
- JavaScript enthusiast, but I probably break more stuff than I fix.
- Always learning, always joking, always a little lost.
- If you’re looking for a “pro,” you’re in the wrong place—but if you want a goofy, welcoming space to talk code, you’re home!
